# CHAD

These programs control the Arduinos on the Controlled Heading Automation Device (CHAD) built by Andrew Kruger and students in the Physics 295 Independent Research course at Wright College.  CHAD_AHRS.ino should be uploaded to the Arduino Micro for the attitude and heading reference system, and the CHAD_Motor.ino should be uploaded to the Arduino Uno controlling the stepper motor.
